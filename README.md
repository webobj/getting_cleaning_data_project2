# Script to Compute Mean and Standard Deviation of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

## run_analysis.R

The script does the following
1. download a dataset from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
2. unzip the data file
3. merge the test and training dataset
4. compute mean and standard deviation for each varable
5. replace activity factor value with the activity label
6. replace variable symbol with variable name
7. store the output in subject_activity_variable_summary.txt.txt
