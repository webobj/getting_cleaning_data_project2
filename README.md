# Script to Compute Mean and Standard Deviation of Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

## run_analysis.R

The script does the following
* download a dataset from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
* unzip the data file
* merge the test and training dataset
* compute mean and standard deviation for each varable
* replace activity factor value with the activity label
* replace variable symbol with variable name
* store the output in subject_activity_variable_summary.txt.txt
